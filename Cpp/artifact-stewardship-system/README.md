# The Artifact Stewardship System

A C++ simulation designed to manage research artifacts and researcher assignments using advanced tree-based data structures.

## Description
This system models how artifacts of varying importance are cataloged, assigned to researchers,
tracked during research, and returned to storage.
Researchers are managed based on specialization and capacity constraints.

The system ensures consistency between artifact and researcher registries and supports reporting and comparison operations.

## Features
- Balanced cataloging and retrieval of artifacts
- Researcher indexing by specialization and capacity
- Artifact assignment and return operations
- Detailed reporting and structural comparisons

## Data Structures Used
- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees
