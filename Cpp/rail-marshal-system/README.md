# The Rail Marshal System

A C++ simulation of a railway marshaling yard designed to model freight wagon classification and train assembly.

## Description
This project simulates how freight wagons arriving at a classification yard are sorted by cargo type and destination,
grouped into temporary blocks, assembled into trains, and dispatched according to rail yard rules.

The system reflects real-world railway logistics and demonstrates how linked data structures enable efficient and rule-based operations.

## Features
- Wagon sorting by cargo type and destination
- Formation of temporary wagon blocks
- Train assembly from classified wagons
- Departure yard and dispatch queue management

## Data Structures Used
- Linked Lists
- Queues
